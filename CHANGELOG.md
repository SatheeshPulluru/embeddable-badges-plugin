# Change Log

* Subtract skipped tests from passed count, so if you skip `9` tests and `12` pass, it will read `12/21` instead of `21/21`.
* Scale `tests` image to support up to 9999 tests.
* Report `0` for no coverage results found instead of `na%`.

## 2.1

* Change coverage action data from `getBuildHealth().getScore()` to line percentage for Cobertura, and element coverage percentage for Clover.

## 1.0
